	    <h1>Protocol design for very low bandwidth systems</h1>
	    <p class="subtitle" >
		Rob Blackwell, October 2006

	    <p>
		I've helped design two protocols for telemetry systems
		over the last couple of years and I want to summarise
		some learning points for future reference.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The general advice these days is "don't design a new
		protocol". With so many standards to choose from and
		with XML supposedly being the common data format, it's
		hard to see why you'd want to create a new
		communications protocol. The trouble is that we're
		talking very low bandwidth here (as low as 10 bytes
		per minute), so every bit has to earn its place.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Reserve a few bits as a message type. This gives you
		future extensibility; new terminals can add new
		features whilst the receiver retains backwards
		compatibility with older models.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		It's surprising how few bits you need to represent
		apparently complex information. You only need 43 bits
		for a full GPS position for example.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Consider using checksums or Cyclic Redundancy
		Checks. CRCs are useful to ensure data integrity. By
		seeding the CRC bytes with an agreed bit pattern you
		can achieve a kind of crude digital signature for non
		repudiation of messages. ISO/IEC 13239 (formerly
		ISO/IEC 3309) contains a popular CRC algorithm.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Provide a sequence number count. Even if you only have
		three bits, you can number successive messages from 0
		through 7, rolling back to 0 instead of 8. It's then
		easy to detect missed packets or packets delivered out
		of sequence.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Telemetry systems often report on a periodic basis
		whilst allowing "polling" to query status at any given
		time. It's a good idea to distinguish periodic reports
		from poll responses to aid diagnosis if a terminal is
		misbehaving.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Implement diagnostics facilities. Build a mobile
		terminated message which causes the transponder to
		reply with a diagnostic packet. Use individual bits to
		represent the current state of various sub systems.
		Make 0 mean faulty and 1 mean good so that you assume
		a fault unless the system actively reports
		otherwise. Transponders are often deployed to far
		flung or inaccessible places, so you need to be able
		to debug them from the comfort of your office.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Consider implementing a reset message to allow remote
		reboot of systems.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		You can implement surprisingly good text messages
		using six bit ASCII.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Many communications systems are asymmetric both in
		terms of bandwidth, quality of service and
		cost. Sometimes it's cheaper to send an important
		message three or four times to more or less guarantee
		delivery rather than implement handshaking
		acknowledgements.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Consider packet layout. Sometimes aligning bits to
		byte boundaries can make parser implementations
		easier, especially in low level computer languages. If
		certain notions such as priority apply to several
		different packet types, make sure the same bit
		positions are used. That way you don't have to parse
		the whole packet.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		If you have a GPS then you have access to an accurate
		clock. If you encode just the seconds past the minute
		within your message, then the receiver can calculate
		transit time (if it too has an accurate clock) for the
		cost of just 5 bits.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		When considering adding generic features, read <a

		Arguments in System Design</a> Saltzer et al.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Question security. Is your communications system an open or closed
		channel? Could it be hacked?
