		When my Grandfather was posted to Skegness for
		training in 1941, he wrote to his Dad at Romford. Here
		is the text of the letter with some of the images from
		the Butlins letter card. I have tried to preserve
		grammatical errors and use of language; I think these
		are an indication of the pressure and uncertainty he
		would have been experiencing. For information, the
		29th was a Saturday.

		Uncle W is Uncle Will White married to Elizabeth who I
		think was Grandad Rowe's sister.  The families were
		very close and used to stay with each other quite
		often I believe.  They were spiritualists and took Dad
		to their meetings sometimes! [Janet Palmer]

		<br>Dear Dad and all at Romford,
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I expect you will be anxiously awaiting a line from me
		as you knew, of course, I was here last Tuesday. I
		hope you won't think me thoughtless in having delayed
		so long writing but I expect Dad will remember that
		the rookie has quite a lot to do + learn in his first
		few days + in addition, of course, I was summoned
		somewhat hurriedly + I've to put my affairs in order
		as best I can from here.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		These views may give you some idea but only faint +
		not so colourful of the place I stay in. We live in
		chalets + have a good few comforts old soldiers would
		think but it's nothing like home.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I seem to do nothing but go on parade "at the double"
		all the time. My sailor suit is very tight as yet but
		twill stretch I'm told and it would be quite in order
		with a few more pockets. I haven't anywhere to put
		pipe, bacca + matches. I seem to get on fairly well so
		far - haven't been into trouble yet but have been
		interviewed by ????  Officer as have two other
		university men here with me in my class.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I expect I may hear about the RAF but I'm afraid
		there's little hope for the Air ?? will not ask for my
		release the Admiralty may release me if I'm not to far
		on in training They are quite fine chaps in my class
		and I shall enjoy myself here I have no doubt tho', of
		course I was disappointed at having to stay. I share a
		chalet with two others one an ex Palestine Police
		Constable the other a railway clerk. We've one other
		teacher here + also a man from Westcliffe. In addition
		two small boys of 12th West Ham who are here as
		P.T. instructors (They were of cub age when I last saw
		them) have both stopped me and spoken to me and we've
		had quite a chat - I think I've also sometime to
		interview the naval schoolmaster here. Well that's all
		for now my love to you all + remember I think about
		you quite a lot. Remember me to Auntie Liz + Uncle W
		when you see them also Hilda when you write - I have
		to do so much kit arranging + boot cleaning etc +
		running to parade I've little time for letter
		writing. I had Vaccination and inoculation yesterday +
		my arm has been very stiff - Had shore leave today +
		went into Skeg. We have an Ensa concert tonight.

		Love to you all your affectionate son and brother,
		Arthur.

		P.S. II If Ada has time could and would she knit me a pair of gloves
		and perhaps a scarf. I'll square her for the wool. Please. And would
		you mention this to Maud. It has been cold here.
