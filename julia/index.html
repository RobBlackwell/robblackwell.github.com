	    <h1>Notes on the Julia programming language</h1>
	    <p class="subtitle" >
		Rob Blackwell
	    </p>
	    <h2> Introduction </h2>
	    <p>
		I'm using the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia
		programming language</a>
		for my <a href="phd.html">PhD</a> work and this page
		records various notes as an aide-m&eacute;moire. I acknowledge that
		some of the material is opinionated, but I'm happy to accept
		corrections or contributions.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h2> Getting Started </h2>
	    <p>
		<a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">Download</a>
		and install the Julia current release.
		Any tutorials by David Sanders are good, e.g.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puMIBYthsjQ">An Invitation to Julia</a>.
		There are some books (see <a href="https://julialang.org/learning/">Learning Julia</a>), but 
		
		the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/">Julia documentation</a> arguably serves as a better resource.
	    </p>

	    <h2> Tools </h2>
	    <p>
		There are lots of options including Juno and Visual Studio Code, but I'm
		just using Emacs and julia-mode.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I really like <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl>">IJulia</a>
		(Jupyter notebooks) and tend to have one per experiment / investigation,
		printing them out and discussing them at supervisory meetings.
		
	    </p>
	    <h2> Python support </h2>
	    <p>
		It's easy to call Python libraries from Julia, and this is a useful trap door if
		you need a specialist library. See <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl">PyCall.jl</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl">Conda.jl</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I like to set <code>export CONDA_JL_VERSION="3"</code> in my shell, prior to installing the Conda.jl package
		to pick up Python 3 instead of Python 2.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Examining <code>Conda.ROOTENV</code> within Julia gives the directory of
		the underlying Python environment. This allows you to hop out
		to a shell, <code>activate</code> the environment and <code>pip install</code>
		odd packages like <code>pynmea2</code>.

		<pre>
using PyCall
@pyimport pynmea2
pynmea2.parse(mystring)
		</pre>
	    </p>
	    <h2> Code reuse </h2>
	    <p>
		I often start protototyping code in an IJulia notebook. When an idea
		starts to come together I move it into a separate text file in
		a directory I call <code>includes</code>. I can then resue it across
		notebooks and scripts with:
		<code>include(expanduser("~/Dropbox/phd/julia/include/plotsutils.jl"));</code>
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Once I have a quorum of code on a particular topic and it starts to
		feel like a reusable library, I create a package using <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/PkgDev.jl">PkgDev</a>.
		I usually move that package directory from <code>~/.julia/vX.X</code> to my regular working
		area and then link back to it using <code> ln -s ~/Dropbox/phd/julia/mypackage.jl mypackage</code>.
		It's a good idea to make the real directory name <code>something.jl</code> and link just <code>something</code>
		otherwise the <code>Pkg.test</code> facility doesn't seem to work.
	    </p>
	    <h2> Plotting </h2>
	    <p>
		There are lots of plotting libraries in Julia. My strategy is to use
		<a href="https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl">Plots.jl</a> whenever I
		can and fall back to <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl">PyPlot</a>
		for certain edge cases.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<A href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl">IJulia</a> with
		<a href="https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl">Plots.jl</a> and
		the <code>plotlyjs()</code> back end is particulalrly good for
		interactive, exploratory programming. You might find that it
		blows-up for large data sets, in which case try changing the backend
		to <code>pyplot()</code>.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Interpolation</h2>
	    <p>
		Interpolation via <code>interp1</code> and <code>interp2</code> is a common thing in MATLAB
		and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl">Interpolations.jl</a>
		is the Julia equivalent. This code is similar:
	    </p>
	    <pre>
using Interpolations

function interp1(X, V, Xq)
    knots = (X,)
    itp = interpolate(knots, V, Gridded(Linear()))
    itp[Xq]
end

function interp2(X, Y, V, Xq, Yq)
    knots = (X,Y)
    itp = interpolate(knots, V, Gridded(Linear()))
    itp[Xq, Yq]
end
	    </pre>
	    <h2> Compared to Python </h2>
	    <p>
		Whilst Python code can be optimised, I find most Julia code to
		be more performant with no effort (although I acknowledge that this
		isn't always the case). For me, the switch to Julia meant that I
		didn't have to move to a high performance compute cluster from
		the convenience of a couple of PCs in the corner of my
		study.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Most of the time, Julia just feels nicer to use, and that's
		important when you spend a large proportion of your life staring
		at a REPL.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The whole Python 2 or Python 3 thing is just irritating.
	    </p>
	    <h2> Compared to MATLAB </h2>
	    <p>
		MATLAB usage is widespread amongst  scientists for good reason; it's established and has very
		high quality, proven libraries. In many ways it is the gold standard for scientific, exploratory
		programming.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Unfortunately, a lot of graduate student science is just grunt work. Reading legacy file formats
		and dealing with <q> big data</q> is a big part of that. MATLAB can do it, but it isn't very elegant. I also
		found problems with compatability between versions. No two scientists
		seem to use the same version and <q> it worked on my machine</q> is a common cry.
		Upgrading a machine is often considered too risky or too expensive.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I found that MATLAB programmers can readily understand Julia code. Googling
		for a MATLAB solution to a problem often turns up a function name, and that
		can be the key to finding an equivalent Julia solution.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Julia is free and open source. The barrier to entry is much lower and
		that's got to be a good thing for <a href="https://reproduciblescience.org/">reprodicible science</a>.
	    </p>
	    <h2> Niggles and problems</h2>
	    <p>
		Because the package system uses git, the local library directory <code>~/.julia</code> ends up being
		large, mine is currently about 3.7G, and time consuming to set up on a new machine. Fortunately,
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yUiLCGegJs">there is a new package manager. Pkg3 in the works</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Some people worry that <q>you're using a language which hasn't even reached 1.0</q>. In practice
		this has never really caused me a problem, the language developers are dilligent about
		deprecating old syntax.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Compiler lag: You <code>Pkg.update()</code>, then the next time you come to use an
		updated package you have to sit and wait for it to compile. This gives the impression
		tha Julia is slow, particularly when working interactively. Once compiled, it's typically
		<em>very</em> fast.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Updating packages can cause alarming WARNING and ERROR messages. Don't
		worry about the warnings, if you get errors then <code>Pkg.build("somepackage")</code>
		is almost always a cure.
	    </p>
	    <h2> Wishlist</h2>
	    <p>
		Is there a way to ask <code>whocalls(f)</code> where f is some function?
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I'd like some refactoring
		tools.
	    </p>
	    <p> <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>  support in Emacs would be great. I have a proof of concept
		SWANK server.
