	    <h1>Notes on the Julia programming language</h1>
	    <p class="subtitle" >
		Rob Blackwell
	    </p>
	    <h2> Introduction </h2>
	    <p>
		I'm using the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia
		programming language</a>
		for my <a href="phd.html">PhD</a> work and this page
		records various notes as an aide-m&eacute;moire. I acknowledge that
		some of the material is opinionated, but I'm happy to accept
		corrections or contributions.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h2> Getting Started </h2>
	    <p>
		<a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">Download</a>
		and install the Julia current release.
		Any tutorials by David Sanders are good, e.g.
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puMIBYthsjQ">An Invitation to Julia</a>.
		There are some books (see <a href="https://julialang.org/learning/">Learning Julia</a>), but 
		
		the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/">Julia documentation</a> arguably serves as a better resource.
	    </p>

	    <h2> Tools </h2>
	    <p>
		There are lots of options including Juno and Visual Studio Code, but I'm
		just using Emac, julia-mode and <a href="https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl">julia-repl</a>.</p>
	    <p>
		I really like <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl>">IJulia</a>
		(Jupyter notebooks) and tend to have one per experiment / investigation,
		printing them out and discussing them at supervisory meetings.
		
	    </p>
	    <h2> Python support </h2>
	    <p>
		It's easy to call Python libraries from Julia, and this is a useful trap door if
		you need a specialist library. See <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl">PyCall.jl</a>
		and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl">Conda.jl</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Examining <code>Conda.ROOTENV</code> within Julia gives the directory of
		the underlying Python environment. This allows you to hop out
		to a shell, <code>activate</code> the environment and <code>pip install</code>
		odd packages like <code>pynmea2</code>.

		<pre>
using PyCall
@pyimport pynmea2
pynmea2.parse(mystring)
		</pre>
	    </p>
	    <h2> Plotting </h2>
	    <p>
		There are lots of plotting libraries in Julia. I use <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl">PyPlot</a>
		forpublication quality plots. <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Winston.jl">Winston</a>
		is useful and fast for interactive use.</p>
	    <h2>Interpolation</h2>
	    <p>
		Interpolation via <code>interp1</code> and <code>interp2</code> is a common thing in MATLAB
		and <a href="https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl">Interpolations.jl</a>
		is the Julia equivalent. This code is similar:
	    </p>
	    <pre>
using Interpolations

function interp1(X, V, Xq)
    knots = (X,)
    itp = interpolate(knots, V, Gridded(Linear()))
    itp[Xq]
end

function interp2(X, Y, V, Xq, Yq)
    knots = (X,Y)
    itp = interpolate(knots, V, Gridded(Linear()))
    itp[Xq, Yq]
end
	    </pre>
	    <h2> Scripting </h2>
	    <p>
		Julia can be used to make shell scripts, using the
		shebang line below:
	    </p>
	    <pre>
#!/usr/bin/env julia
	    </pre>
	    <p>
		This can be useful in large projects where it allows
		for Make to be used to build products incrementally.
		Beware, the Julia start up time can be large in comparison
		to the run time of your script so it can be very inefficient
		to work with small files and tasks.
	    </p>
	    <h2> Logging </h2>
	    <p>
		The output of <code>@info()</code>, <code>@warn()</code> and <code>@error()</code>
		is sent to STDERR instead of STDOUT making them ideal
		mechanisms for instrumenting and logging scripts,
		without messing up output.</p>
	    <pre>
$ ./script.jl > output.txt 2> log.txt
	    </pre>
	    <p>
		The above results in two files, output.txt with
		everything your printed and log.txt with everything
		written by info, warn and error.
	    </p>
	    <h2> CPU and memory </h2>



	    <p>Julia garbage collection is now GC.gc()</p>
	    <p>

	    <h2>Masking confusion</h2>
	    <p>
		<pre>
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
3×3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9

julia> a .> 3
3×3 BitArray{2}:
 false  false  false
  true   true   true
  true   true   true
		</pre>
	    </p>
	    <p>
		All good so far, but the following result can be a surprise - we only get the values,
		not the shape.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		<pre>

julia> a[a .>3]
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
 4
 7
 5
 8
 6
 9
		</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
		    However mutating the array does work:
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre>
julia> a[a .>3] .= 3
6-element view(::Array{Int64,1}, [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]) with eltype Int64:
 3
 3
 3
 3
 3
 3

julia> a
3×3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 3  3  3
 3  3  3
		</pre>
		</p>
	    <h2> Compared to Python </h2>
	    <p>
		Whilst Python code can be optimised, I find most Julia
		code to be more performant with no effort (although I
		acknowledge that this isn't always the case). For me,
		the switch to Julia meant that I didn't have to move
		to a high performance compute cluster from the
		convenience of a couple of PCs in the corner of my
		study.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Most of the time, Julia just feels nicer to use, and
		that's important when you spend a large proportion of
		your life staring at a REPL.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The whole Python 2 or Python 3 thing is just irritating.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		That said, there is still a lot of Python code under the
		Julia hood (e.g. IJulia) so don't knock it!
	    </p>
	    <h2> Compared to MATLAB </h2>
	    <p>
		MATLAB usage is widespread amongst scientists for good
		reason; it's established and has very high quality,
		proven libraries. In many ways it is the gold standard
		for scientific, exploratory programming.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Unfortunately, a lot of graduate student science is
		just grunt work. Reading legacy file formats and
		dealing with <q> big data</q> is a big part of
		that. MATLAB can do it, but it isn't very elegant. I
		also found problems with compatability between
		versions. No two scientists seem to use the same
		version and <q> it worked on my machine</q> is a
		common cry.  Upgrading a machine is often considered
		too risky or too expensive.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I found that MATLAB programmers can readily understand
		Julia code. Googling for a MATLAB solution to a
		problem often turns up a function name, and that can
		be the key to finding an equivalent Julia solution.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Julia is free and open source. The barrier to entry is much lower and
		that's got to be a good thing for <a href="https://reproduciblescience.org/">reprodicible science</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		There is a <A href="https://github.com/JuliaIO/MAT.jl">mat.jl</a> library
		which allows reading of MATLAB MAT files. It used to allow writing,
		but since Julia 1.0 something seems to be broken with writing.<p>
	    </p>
	    <h2> Niggles and problems</h2>
	    <p>
		Julia is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp-1_vs._Lisp-2">Lisp-1</a> so
		naming variables so that they don't clash with functions can sometimes be
		annoying, e.g
	    </p>
<pre>
julia> wheels = wheels(mycar)
ERROR: invalid redefinition of constant wheels
</pre>
			      

	    <h2> Wishlist</h2>
	    <p>
		Is there a way to ask <code>whocalls(f)</code> where f is some function?
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I'd like some refactoring
		tools.
	    </p>
	    <p> <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>  support in Emacs would be great. I have a proof of concept
		SWANK server.
