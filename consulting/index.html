	    <p class="subtitle" >
		Software consultancy
	    </p>
	    <p>I'm a
		<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">software
		    hacker in the old-fashioned sense of the word</a>
		and a former Research and Development Director at <a href="http://www.two10degrees.com" >two10degrees</a>.</p>

	    <p>My work has won a number of awards, including British
		Computer Society best IT Project. I received nine Microsoft
		Most Valuable Professional awards for my work with Virtual
		Earth, Windows Live Services and Microsoft Azure. A
		project at the Royal National Lifeboat Institution is
		credited with helping to save the lives of nine fishermen.</p>

	    <p>I'm studying for a <a href="../phd/index.html">PhD</a>, but I am still
		taking on some occasional, part time consultancy work.</p>

	    <p>Recent projects include:

		<ul>
		    <li>Processing oil and gas data to build a map of hazards to
			low flying aircraft in the North Sea.
		    </li>

		    <li>A dissolved oxygen monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi.
		    </li>

		    <li>Informal advice and mentoring to an early stage technlogy
			start up.
		    </li>

		    <li>Recovering and converting archive data from some old hard
			drives, zip drives and floppy disks.
		    </li>
		</ul>
	    </p>

	    <p>
		These days I particularly enjoy scientific programming in
		<a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> and Geographical
		Information Systems and satellite remote sensing work with
		Python.
	    </p>

	    <p>
		I like a challenge - Contact me if you think I might be
		able to help you.
