	    <h1>My Grandfather</h1>

		My Aunt Janet, a teacher, asked my grandfather to
		record some World War II Memories in 1994 so that she
		could use the material in her class history lesson.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		I recently converted the audio cassette recording to
		MP3 in an effort to preserve it for future generations
		and make it more widely available.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The recording describes my maternal
		grandfather's experience as a geography teacher
		in 1939, the announcement of Hitler invading Poland,
		evacuation from West Ham and an air raid.

		file].

		Sadly there are no further installments. It would have
		been interesting to hear of his experiences taking
		morse code in the Navy.
