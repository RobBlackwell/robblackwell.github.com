	    <h1> Real-time reporting of ecosystem metrics from acoustic sensors on gliders </h1>
	    <p class="subtitle" >

		The ability of AUVs such as underwater gliders to
		carry active acoustic sensors pertinent to ecosystem
		research has been shown (Guihen et al. 2014).
		However, due to their high data volume creation, these
		sensors currently store data locally for retrieval and
		analysis once the platform is recovered.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		One of the large appeals of gliders is directing them
		to regions of interest and receiving data in
		real-time. The current simple echosounder integrated
		into gliders generates 256 byte strings per ping (ping
		rate of 0.25 – 1 Hz). Newer, more complex wideband
		echosounders an order of magnitude more.  These data
		need processing and constraining into metrics
		(acoustic area backscattering strength, vertical
		distribution, aggregation – e.g. Burgos and Horne,
		2008) onboard the glider, which can then be
		transmitted back. Thus enabling ecosystem descriptors
		to be transmitted back to shore from the glider/AUV in
		real-time and realizing these platforms capabilities
		for ecosystem research relevant to both fisheries
		management and impact assessments.

		This PhD project will work with state-of-the-art
		acoustic instruments to develop onboard processing
		capabilities to realize this challenge.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		When acoustic data are displayed in echograms,
		aggregations and scattering of zooplankton and fish
		are evident forming diverse spatial patterns such as
		schools, shoals and diffuse clouds.  Echotrace
		classification techniques enable this complex
		information to be simplified. This project will use
		existing acoustic datasets from wideband and
		narrowband echosounders to develop advanced
		compression methods that will allow the pertinent
		information to be transmitted down the low-bandwidth
		channel and hence influence the mission. Given that
		onboard processing is limited, our initial approach
		will be to state-of-the-art machine learning methods
		such as Deep Neural Networks (currently being used in
		lip-reading) which are trained expensively (offline)
		but need little run-time computation. Our aim is to
		develop a compression hierarchy in which the most
		needed information is sent first, followed by the
		nuances.
